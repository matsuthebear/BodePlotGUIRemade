# BodePlotGUIRemade
This application, made with MATLAB App Designer, is the remake of the Bode Plot GUI made by Eric Cheever

## Info
This project was made to pass the MATLAB exam at the University of Verona, Italy. 
The main objective was to understand how to create an application with GUI, using only App Designer (instead of *guide*).
Everything you need to know to understand this application is described within the comments. The original plotting code was written by Erik Cheever.
